# managing many infos in struct

Let me help you understand the options for handling image structures in your so_long game.

### Option 1: Embedding image pointers directly in t_game
```c:includes/so_long.h
typedef struct s_game
{
    // ... existing members ...
    void    *img_wall;
    void    *img_player;
    void    *img_collective;
    void    *img_exit;
    void    *img_floor;
}   t_game;
```

### Option 2: Using separate t_image struct
```c:includes/so_long.h
typedef struct s_image
{
    void    *wall;
    void    *player;
    void    *collective;
    void    *exit;
    void    *floor;
}   t_image;

typedef struct s_game
{
    // ... existing members ...
    t_image images;  // Not a pointer, direct embedding
}   t_game;
```

### Pros and Cons:

#### Option 1 (Direct members):
👍 Pros:
- Simpler structure
- Direct access to images (`game->img_wall`)
- No need for additional struct

👎 Cons:
- Less organized code
- If you need to pass multiple images around, you need to pass them individually
- Harder to add image-related functionality

#### Option 2 (Separate t_image):
👍 Pros:
- Better organization
- Easier to add image-related functionality
- Can pass all images as one unit if needed
- More maintainable as project grows
- Clearer separation of concerns

👎 Cons:
- Slightly more complex structure
- Slightly longer access syntax (`game->images.wall`)

### Recommendation:
I recommend Option 2 (separate t_image struct) because:
1. It's more organized and maintainable
2. No need for additional malloc since it's embedded in t_game
3. Better separation of concerns
4. Easier to add image-related functionality later

### Usage Example:
```c
// Initialization
game->images.wall = mlx_xpm_file_to_image(game->mlx_pointer, "wall.xpm", &width, &height);
game->images.player = mlx_xpm_file_to_image(game->mlx_pointer, "player.xpm", &width, &height);
// etc.

// Cleanup
if (game->images.wall)
    mlx_destroy_image(game->mlx_pointer, game->images.wall);
if (game->images.player)
    mlx_destroy_image(game->mlx_pointer, game->images.player);
// etc.
```

This approach gives you better code organization **without the overhead of additional memory allocation**, since the t_image struct is directly embedded in t_game.
