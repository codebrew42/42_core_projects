powerset

allowed functions: atoi, printf, malloc, calloc, realloc, free

args:	n[s]
	[s] - set of numbers
	[n] - integer value

task: 
display subsets of [s] whose sum is equal to n. No duplicates

malloc error - exit with code 1
if there is no set satisfying the task print new line
empty set is also sub-set!
set like in python
positive 1 negative (??)

We will not test with invalid set

./a.out 5 3 2 1
=> res : 3 2

./a.out 5 2 3 1 0
=> res : 2 3
=> res : 2 3 -> 2 3 0
