In the function signature and implementation:

```cpp
Zombie& operator=(Zombie& source)
{
    ...
    return *this;
}
```

the symbols `&`, `&`, and `*` each have specific and important meanings in C++.

## **First `&`: In the Return Type (`Zombie&`)**

- The `&` in `Zombie&` means the function returns a reference to a `Zombie` object, not a copy.
- This is crucial for assignment operators in C++. Returning a reference allows for assignment chaining, such as `a = b = c;`, where the result of `b = c` is a reference to `b`, which is then assigned to `a`[3].
- If you returned by value (just `Zombie`), it would create an unnecessary copy, which is inefficient and could cause problems if you want to modify the original object[3].

## **Second `&`: In the Parameter (`Zombie& source`)**

- The `&` in the parameter means the function receives a reference to a `Zombie` object, not a copy.
- This allows the function to access (and potentially modify) the original `source` object directly, without making a copy, which is more efficient, especially for large objects[4].
- Passing by reference is also required if you want to support self-assignment safely (e.g., `z = z;`), and to avoid slicing if `Zombie` is a base class[4].

## **`*` in `return *this`**

- Inside a class member function, `this` is a pointer to the current object (of type `Zombie*`).
- `*this` dereferences the pointer, giving you a reference to the actual object (`Zombie&`).
- Returning `*this` matches the function's return type (`Zombie&`), allowing the assignment operator to return a reference to the object that was just assigned to[3][5].

> You return *this so you can write normal compound C++ = statements like: `p3 = p2 = p1;` because that statement is basically: `p3.operator=(p2.operator=(p1));` ... If `operator=` didn't return `*this`, you'd have nothing meaningful to pass into the next assignment.[3]

## **Summary Table**

| Symbol | Context                  | Meaning                                                         |
|--------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `&`    | Return type (`Zombie&`)  | Returns a reference to the current object (enables chaining)    |
| `&`    | Parameter (`Zombie& src`)| Accepts a reference (avoids copying, allows direct access)      |
| `*`    | `return *this`           | Dereferences `this` pointer to return a reference to the object |

These conventions are standard in C++ for implementing assignment operators and ensure efficient, correct, and idiomatic code[3][4][5].
